# CSFloat-Sticker-Application-Checker
This tool is written in Python and uses Selenium to automatically check for sticker application data on CSFloat, previously known as CSGOFloat. It requires logging into CSFloat through Steam

The tool takes an input of sticker names (optional) and IDs (mandatory) and scans through CSFloat. Depending on how many stickers you want to check, there may be a 30 minute cooldown enforced by CSFloat.

If you get a recaptcha error, simply refresh the page.

The output is written to a .txt file named the date and time of completion.
